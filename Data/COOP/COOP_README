We use a retail market dataset describing the purchases of the customers of COOP, one of the largest supermarket chains in Italy.

We do not include the COOP files regarding the retail records as they are not publicly available data.
However they are accessible through the SoBigData Catalogue in this link: http://data.d4science.org/ctlg/ResourceCatalogue/retail_market_data.

SoBigData is the European Research Infrastructure for Big Data and Social Mining. 
For more details about the EU Project you can visit the Project Site: http://www.sobigdata.eu/

Due to privacy and confidentiality reasons the access is only on-site visit.
