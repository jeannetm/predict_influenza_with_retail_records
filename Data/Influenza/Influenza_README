We include the files reporting the influenza activity in Italy as officially monitored by the Italian National Institute of Health, 
Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS) and the Interuniversity Research Centre on Influenza (Ciri), through a system called Influnet.
The reports are publicly available at the website of Influnet http://old.iss.it/flue/index.php?lang=1&tipo=13.
