# predict_influenza_with_retail_records

We describe our methodology that uses retail market data to improve seasonal influenza forecasting. We consider supermarket retail data as a proxy signal for influenza, through the identification of sentinel baskets, i.e., products bought together by a population of selected customers. We develop a nowcasting and forecasting approach that provides estimates for influenza incidence in Italy up to 4 weeks ahead.
